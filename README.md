Overview
--------
The goal of the TrueNFT proof-of-concept is to demonstrate an on-chain implementation of two features missing from current NFT blockchains, layer 1 custody, and permanant storage. These are provided as modifications on top of the Sia blockchain, and implemented to some level of completeness and reasonable accuracy to the original specifications. For more details, TrueNFT_Spec.pdf in this branch is a useful place to get started. 

Repository Structure
--------------------
The nft_custody branch contains a complete chain-of-custody implementation, and nft_cli is a work-in-progress branch to utilise this implementation to provide a full-featured nft client and storage payout system.
